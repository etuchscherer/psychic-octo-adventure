        %b Pop Salad
    %p.even Pop Salad is the gamified way of getting the most current pop news. The application crawls the web and gathers    |
    relevant stories for celebrity gossip and pop culture. It then does some magic to figure out who is the most buzz worthy  |
    celebrity at that moment. The site includes e-commerce, mini-games, internal and external api's, charting and a very           |
    powerful back-end.                                                                                                  |

        %b Feral Motion
    %p.even Feral Motion is a really neat RFID activated camera system designed for action sports. Feral Motion's       |
    hi-tech cameras sense when a user crosses it's path. It then auto-magicly records video of the target and uploads   |
    immediately, out-of-the-box. Basically, you ride down the mountain, have video shot, and by the time you finish     |
    your lap, you're sharing that video with your friends.                                                              |

        %b The Nerdy-Car app
    %p.even Still in development, this app measures the various ways which we spend money on our vehicles. It does      |
    some math and comes up with an average of how much money you spend on Maintenance, Operation, and Staying Legal.    |
    Then it makes smart recommendations geared towards saving you money. Cause sometimes, trading in a car that you're  |
    upside down on can save money. |
